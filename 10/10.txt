BOM(Browser Object Model) is used to interact with the browser.
The default object of browser is window.

It means that we can call its function without "window.*".
  window.alert("Hello World!");
  
The document object represents an html document.
It forms DOM (Document Object Model).

WINDOW
 - DOCUMENT
 - HISTORY
 - SCREEN
 - NAVIGATOR
 - LOCATION
 
"window" object represents window in browser.
It's created automaticaly.

"window" - object of browser, not object of JS.

Note: if html contains frames, browser creates additional window objects for each frame

Methods of window object:
- alert()
- confirm()
- prompt()
- open()
- close()
