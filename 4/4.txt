There are 5 primitive data types in JS:
- String (sequence of characters, e.g. "Hello")
- Number (numeric values, e.g. 100)
- Boolean (boolean value true or false)
- Undefined (undefined value)
- Null (null, i.e. no value at all)

There are 3 non-primitive data types:
- Object (instance through which we can access members)
- Array (group of similar values)
- RegExp (regular expression)

There are following types of operators in JS:
1) Arithmetic
2) Comparison
3) Bitwise
4) Logical
5) Assignment
6) Special

Arithmetics:
1. +
2. -
3. *
4. / 
5. % Modulus division (20%10=0)
6.++ Increment
7. -- Decrement

Comparison Operators:
1. == is equal to
2. === identical (equal and of same type)
3. != not equal
4. !== not identical
5. > greater than
6. >= greater than or equal to
7. < less than
8. <=

JS Bitwise Operators
1. & - AND (10==20 & 20==33)
2. | - OR  (10==20|20==33)
3. ^ XOR
4. ~ NOT
etc

JS Logical Operators:
&& - AND
|| OR
! NOT


JS Special Operators
1. (?:) it's like if else
2. , 
3. delete - deletes the property from object
4. in - checks if object has the given property
5. instanceof - checks if the object is an instance of given type
6. new - creates an instance (object)
7. typeof - checks the type of object
8. void - it discards the expression's return value
9. yield - checks what is returned in a generator by the generator's iterator
